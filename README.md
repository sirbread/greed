# greed
greed. it's ubiquitous. <br>
and now, it's a simple game of psychology and numbers. <br>

## how it works
- every round, pick an integer between 1 and 10.
- at the end of the round, points are calculated as:
  `(number you picked) / (number of people who picked that number)`
- if multiple people pick the same number, they split the points.  
  for example, if 4 people choose 8, each gets 2 points (8 / 4).  
  if only you pick 7, you get all 7 points.

## features
- strategic gameplay (simple rules, deep strategy)
- live scoreboard
- a chat (fittingly named _bluff_)
- stats graphs showing numbers vs. points correlation
- firebase auth (log in with google)
- your greed rate (average) (it disses you on it too lol)

## setup 
1. clone thy repo
2. set up firebase (the json file with the secrets should be named `serviceAccountKeys.json`)
3. set up your .env
4. run `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload` and go to `127.0.0.1:8000`
