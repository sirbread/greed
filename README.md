# greed
do you play the game or does your greed play you? <br>
todo: 
- "greed rate" (average of score you submitted as final, disses you on your average)
- chat (calling it "bluff" it seems fitting)
- ~~help page~~
- ~~graphs with matplotlib~~
- ~~firebase login (watch and indian tutorial guy idk how it works)~~
- ~~game ending @ x points~~
- style it 
- ~~clog up viewing ability to view POST areas~~
- ~~reverse graph viewing (like 3-2-1 instead of 1-2-3)~~
- ~~"greed game 1 starting in... 1 day, 12 hours 58 minutes, 10 seconds"~~

todo, but html pages
- index (home, maybe like a go/login button here)
- game.html (pick a number page)
- ~~login.html (login)~~
- ~~graphs.html (for my stats nerds)~~
- chat.html (bluff)
