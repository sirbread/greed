# greed
do you play the game or does your greed play you? <br>
todo: 
- ~~"greed rate" (average of score you submitted as final, disses you on your average)~~
- ~~chat (calling it "bluff" it seems fitting)** (todo: fix profanity filter, add links back to and into chat)~~
- ~~help page~~
- ~~graphs with matplotlib~~
- ~~firebase login (watch and indian tutorial guy idk how it works)~~
- ~~game ending @ x points~~
- ~~style it~~ 
- ~~clog up viewing ability to view POST areas~~
- ~~reverse graph viewing (like 3-2-1 instead of 1-2-3)~~
- ~~"greed game 1 starting in... 1 day, 12 hours 58 minutes, 10 seconds"~~
- ~~lower requests per second~~

todo, but html pages
- ~~index (the actual game)~~
- ~~home.html (home page with like "login" and visuals, *redirect here if it's their first time and store in browser)~~
- ~~login.html (login)~~
- ~~graphs.html (for my stats nerds)~~
- ~~chat.html (bluff)**~~

**i really need to pack this project up, mayeb this will not be implemented unless i make it half-assed

## credits/disclaimer/boring stuff ðŸ¥€
### ai usage in this project
yes, _some_ parts of this project were generated by ai. i'll define what stuff was gen ai to be transparent: <br>
(since the project is still in _heavy_ development, i will update the list if needed.) <br>
firebaseConfig (index.html) - i was completley new to firebase and wanted some assistance :) (9 lines)<br> 
formatDuration (index.html) - i accidentally made this function in python until i realized i was supposed to put it in index, and i wasn't having it lol (10 lines) <br> 
verify_firebase_token (main.py) - again, i was new to firebase and didn't know a thing (9 lines) <br>
foramtting (not styling) (graphs.html) - it broke like 4 times in 30 seconds so i gave up :pray: (101-120)
### video creds
